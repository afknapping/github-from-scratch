# Outline of this material

## Patterns

- There are two main parts: one manadotory for the basics, one freeform for experimenting.
- The main structure is linear, meaning you first do part 1, then part 2
- every page/step is a small challenge
- the steps challenges in part 2 are not linear (though it is recommended to with switching from online usage to offline (using github gui tool and editor))
- "If you have a peer" sections are optional and are about "social coding"
- an extra section is about forking your github identicon onto the Wall of Fame.

## Part 1: Learn to sail

### Github repo
- repo => version control commit history ("folder with a journal")
- make `index.html` => files, documents
- put "hello world" inside => text
- goto username.github.io :)

### Interlude: Learn to swim

(formerly know as: HTML – how does it work?)

  - put into p-tag => tags & html ("clothing", "uniforms")
  - add second p-tag with "to the kittens!!11!" => (transfer)
  - wrap kittens in a-tag => links ("portals")

### Add a second page a and link to it
- make `kittens.html` => (transfer)
- put hello world within p-tag inside => (transfer)
- put img-tag inside => images
- add src-attribute => data ("adress, haircolor, shoesize")
- add href to kittens-link on index => transfer ("tell portal where to take you")
- add link to index on kittens => (transfer)

### BREAK

### DATA <3
- make config, add title => data in new format ("frontmatter" vs attributes)
- put `{{ site.title }}` into title-tag => site-wide templates/placeholders ("blanks for adress on postcard")

### using a layout
- make layout folder and file => (transfer)
- put inside: p-tag with hello layout and `{{ content }}` => (transfer)
- add layout to index and kittens => (transfer)
- put "menu" into layout, remove links from index and kittens  => (transfer)
- add titles to index and kittens, add `{{ page.title }}` => page-wide data, transfer

### You are awesome!


## Part 2: Sail away

### Local Development: Github Gui Tool and Code editor
### HTML
### CSS
### Markdown
### Yaml & Liquid => make a blog
### Git

## Appendix: Fork yourself into the Wall of Fame
