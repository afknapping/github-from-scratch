"3","I love anonymous feedback ;-)  Good thing, that :-) Okay: Well, to put it simply, the event was smashing! Could nearly not have been any better... besides... now that i think about it... yes... there was sth missing: .. an explanation of  Git and  GitHub into the dependencies of ""the landscape"" : ... as far as I was concerned   the transfer from the example-code to my realtime projects was a bit harsh  ! ... and ... besides there was no initial explanation of what Git is and what github is and how they fit into everything else // especially Jekyll and html go well together on github -  but not nessesarily locally    , ... so I wondered what  actually will be needed to run my repositories locally - I learned  that it is best to run stuff  on a localserver  (due to Git-delay online)  - and how to get that running (under windows ;-) ... it would have added up some extra value to grasp that right from the start ... But where is the difference between perfect and perfect anyway ;-)  ","2013-12-10 22:19:04","public","","","80.171.144.77","1","1"
"4","- Great learning material, great location, well organized, great buffet
- Nothing
- Only minor corrections in the material, maybe a short introduction round of the participants (short!) and a short introduction of the coaches. Once people started with the material they only worked together with the people around them. Some more interaction would have been nice. But that's a personal opinion. Some prefer it the way it was. 

General: Awesome event, thanks so much for everything. ","2013-12-10 22:24:24","public","","","80.171.110.10","1","1"
"5","Oh, one more thing: It would be great to have some information about the difference of a) git, b) github and c) github pages. I was confused a little bit. But this is just a little thing that could be improved!","2013-12-10 22:27:29","public","","","80.171.110.10","1","1"
"6","- mir gefiel, dass man sich in kleinen Gruppen ""selbst"" zum Ziel gebracht hat. Dadurch hatte man schöne kleine Erfolgserlebnisse. 
- alle Coaches waren sehr hilfsbereit und geduldig und haben immer noch am Ende des Tages nett gelächelt
- ich habe keine negative Kritik.","2013-12-11 09:06:05","public","","","92.231.175.93","1","1"
